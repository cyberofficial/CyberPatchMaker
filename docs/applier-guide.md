# Applier Tool Guide

Complete guide to using the CyberPatchMaker applier tool for applying delta patches to installations.

## Overview

The applier tool safely applies binary patches to existing installations. It verifies the current version, creates backups, applies changes, and validates the result.

## Basic Usage

### Apply Patch with Full Verification

**The recommended method** - apply patch with complete safety checks:

```bash
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./myapp --verify
```

This will:
1. Load and display patch information
2. Verify current version is 1.0.0 (pre-verification)
3. Create backup of current installation
4. Apply all patch operations
5. Verify result matches version 1.0.3 (post-verification)
6. Remove backup on success (or restore on failure)

**Example Output:**
```
Loading patch: patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch

=== Patch Information ===
From Version: 1.0.0
To Version:   1.0.3
Key File:     program.exe
Created:      2025-10-04 10:30:00
Patch Size:   2.1 MB
Compression:  zstd

Operations:
  5 files to add
  12 files to modify
  3 files to delete
  2 directories to add

Time elapsed: 12.3 seconds
```

---

### Dry-Run Mode (Preview Changes)

**Preview what would happen** without making any changes:

```bash
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./myapp --dry-run
```

This will:
1. Load patch information
2. Display what operations would be performed
3. **NOT** create backup
4. **NOT** apply any changes
5. **NOT** modify any files

**Example Output:**
```
Loading patch: patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch

=== Patch Information ===
From Version: 1.0.0
To Version:   1.0.3
Key File:     program.exe

=== DRY RUN MODE - NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE ===

Would perform the following operations:
  ADD:    libs/newfeature.dll (2.1 MB)
  MODIFY: program.exe (52.4 MB)
  MODIFY: data/config.json (1.2 KB)
  DELETE: libs/oldfeature.dll
  ... (16 more operations)

Total size of changes: 54.7 MB

Dry-run completed successfully
No changes were made to your installation
```

## Safety Features

### Pre-Verification

Before any changes are made, the applier verifies:

1. **Key File Verification**
   - Checks that the key file (e.g., program.exe) exists
   - Calculates SHA-256 hash of the key file
   - Compares against required hash from patch
   - **Fails if hash doesn't match** → Wrong version or corrupted

2. **Required Files Verification**
   - Checks that all required files exist
   - Calculates SHA-256 hash of each required file
   - Compares against required hashes from patch
   - **Fails if any hash doesn't match** → Modified or corrupted installation

**If Pre-Verification Fails:**
- **NO BACKUP is created** (why backup corrupted state?)
- **NO CHANGES are made** (patch rejected immediately)
- Error message explains what's wrong
- Installation remains in current state (unmodified)

---

### Backup Creation

**When:** After pre-verification passes, before any operations

**Location:** `<current-dir>.backup`
- Example: If current-dir is `C:\MyApp\`, backup is `C:\MyApp.backup\`

**Contents:** Complete recursive copy of entire installation
- All files at all levels
- All subdirectories
- Complete directory structure
- File permissions (where supported)

**Cleanup:**
- On success: Backup is automatically removed
- On failure: Backup is preserved for restoration

---

### Post-Verification

After all operations are applied, the applier verifies:

1. **Modified Files Verification**
   - Calculates SHA-256 hash of every modified/added file
   - Compares against expected hashes from patch
   - **Fails if any hash doesn't match** → Operation failed or corrupted

2. **Target Key File Verification**
   - Verifies key file now has target version hash
   - Ensures version was successfully updated

**If Post-Verification Fails:**
- **Backup is restored** (return to clean state)
- Error message explains what went wrong
- Installation returns to original state
- User can investigate and retry

---

## Understanding Errors

### Pre-Verification Errors

**"Key file checksum mismatch"**
```
Error: patch application failed: key file verification failed: 
  key file checksum mismatch: 
  expected 63573ff071ea5fa2...
  got      8f3c9d2e1a4b7c5e...
```

**Meaning:** Your key file (program.exe) doesn't match expected version

**Causes:**
- Applying wrong patch (e.g., 1.0.0→1.0.3 patch to version 1.0.1)
- Key file was modified or corrupted
- Different application entirely

**Solution:**
- Verify you have the correct version installed
- Use patch matching your current version
- Re-install clean version if corrupted

---

**"Required file missing or modified"**
```
Error: patch application failed: required file verification failed: 
  file "data/config.json" checksum mismatch:
  expected a1b2c3d4e5f6...
  got      z9y8x7w6v5u4...
```

**Meaning:** A file in your installation was modified or corrupted

**Causes:**
- User edited files manually
- File corruption
- Incomplete installation
- Previous patch failed

**Solution:**
- Re-install clean source version
- Don't manually edit application files
- Check disk for errors

---

### Operation Errors

**"Permission denied"**
```
Error: failed to write file: permission denied
Restoring from backup...
```

**Meaning:** Cannot write to files (insufficient permissions)

**Causes:**
- Files are in use (application running)
- Insufficient user permissions
- Read-only files
- Antivirus blocking

**Solution:**
- Close the application before patching
- Run applier as administrator
- Check file permissions
- Temporarily disable antivirus

---

**"Disk full"**
```
Error: failed to write file: no space left on device
Restoring from backup...
```

**Meaning:** Not enough disk space

**Causes:**
- Disk is full
- Backup requires additional space
- Large patch operations

**Solution:**
- Free up disk space (backup needs ~installation size)
- Move to larger disk
- Clean temporary files

---

### Post-Verification Errors

**"Modified file checksum mismatch"**
```
Error: post-patch verification failed:
  file "program.exe" checksum mismatch after patching
Restoring from backup...
```

**Meaning:** Patch application produced wrong result

**Causes:**
- Corrupted patch file
- Disk error during write
- Binary diff application failed
- Memory corruption

**Solution:**
- Re-download patch file
- Check disk for errors
- Retry patching
- Report bug if persistent

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Safe Production Update

Update production installation with full safety:

```bash
# Always use --verify for production!
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.2-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir C:\Production\MyApp --verify
```

**What Happens:**
1. Verifies you're running 1.0.2
2. Creates backup at `C:\Production\MyApp.backup\`
3. Applies changes
4. Verifies result is 1.0.3
5. Removes backup on success

---

### Example 2: Preview Before Applying

Preview changes before committing:

```bash
# First: Dry-run to see what would change
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./myapp --dry-run

# If everything looks good, apply for real:
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./myapp --verify
```

---

### Example 3: Testing Environment (Less Safe)

For testing environments where speed matters more than safety:

```bash
# Skip verification and backup (FASTER but RISKY!)
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./test-app
```

**WARNING:** Only use this for disposable test environments!

---

### Example 4: Network Drive Installation

Applying patch to network-installed application:

```bash
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir \\server\share\MyApp --verify
```

**Note:** Backup will be at `\\server\share\MyApp.backup\`

---

## Performance Expectations

### Small Patches (<10MB)
- **Pre-verification**: 2-5 seconds
- **Backup creation**: 10-30 seconds
- **Apply operations**: 3-10 seconds
- **Post-verification**: 2-5 seconds
- **Total time**: ~30-60 seconds

### Medium Patches (10-100MB)
- **Pre-verification**: 5-10 seconds
- **Backup creation**: 30-60 seconds
- **Apply operations**: 10-30 seconds
- **Post-verification**: 5-10 seconds
- **Total time**: ~1-2 minutes

### Large Patches (100MB+)
- **Pre-verification**: 10-20 seconds
- **Backup creation**: 1-3 minutes
- **Apply operations**: 30-90 seconds
- **Post-verification**: 10-20 seconds
- **Total time**: ~2-5 minutes

**Factors:**
- Installation size (backup time)
- Number of files (verification time)
- Disk speed (SSD vs HDD)
- Patch size (operation time)

## Best Practices

### Before Patching

1. **Close the Application**: Ensure application is not running
2. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure space for backup (~installation size)
3. **Backup Separately**: Create your own backup for critical systems
4. **Test First**: Use --dry-run to preview changes
5. **Right Patch**: Verify you have the correct patch for your version

### During Patching

1. **Use --verify**: Always use --verify flag for production
2. **Don't Interrupt**: Let the process complete
3. **Watch Output**: Monitor for errors or warnings
4. **Stable Connection**: Ensure stable disk/network access

### After Patching

1. **Test Application**: Verify application works correctly
2. **Check Version**: Confirm version was updated
3. **Remove Backup**: If successful, remove .backup folder
4. **Keep Patch**: Keep patch file for future re-installations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Patch Fails with "Version Mismatch"

**Problem:** Current version doesn't match patch requirements

**Solution:**
1. Check current version: `./myapp/program.exe --version`
2. Find correct patch for your version
3. If no patch exists, reinstall target version

---

### Backup Restoration Fails

**Problem:** Cannot restore from backup after failure

**Solution:**
1. Check disk space
2. Manually copy files from `.backup` to installation
3. Check permissions
4. Contact support if manual restoration fails

---

### Slow Performance

**Problem:** Patching takes very long

**Solution:**
1. Check disk speed (HDD vs SSD)
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Ensure antivirus isn't scanning
4. Check if disk is fragmented (HDD)

---

### Application Won't Start After Patching

**Problem:** Application fails to run after successful patch

**Solution:**
1. Check post-verification passed (all hashes correct)
2. Re-apply patch
3. Restore from .backup if it still exists
4. Re-install clean version and try again
5. Report bug with error logs
