# Hash Verification System Deep Dive

## Overview

The Hash Verification System is the **cornerstone of security and reliability** in CyberPatchMaker. Every file operation is protected by SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to ensure data integrity, detect tampering, and prevent corrupted patch applications. This document provides a comprehensive deep dive into how hash verification works at every stage of the patch lifecycle.

## Why Hash Verification?

### The Problem Without Verification

Without cryptographic verification, several catastrophic scenarios could occur:

1. **Silent Corruption**: Files corrupted during transfer/storage are not detected
2. **Wrong Version Patching**: Patch applied to modified or wrong version succeeds but breaks application
3. **Tampered Files**: Malicious modifications go undetected
4. **Partial Updates**: Incomplete patch application leaves system in inconsistent state
5. **Network Errors**: Download corruption causes broken installation

### The Solution: SHA-256 Verification

CyberPatchMaker uses **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing** at three critical verification points:

1. **Pre-Patch Verification**: Verify source version is EXACTLY correct before starting
2. **During Patch**: Verify each operation as it's applied
3. **Post-Patch Verification**: Verify target version is EXACTLY correct after completion

**Result**: **Zero-tolerance** for corruption, tampering, or version mismatches.

## SHA-256 Algorithm

### What is SHA-256?

**SHA-256** (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that:

- **Input**: Any file of any size (bytes)
- **Output**: 256-bit (32-byte) hexadecimal hash
- **Properties**:
  - **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same hash
  - **One-way**: Cannot reverse hash to get original data
  - **Collision-resistant**: Virtually impossible to find two files with same hash
  - **Avalanche effect**: Tiny change to input completely changes hash

### Example Hash Calculation

```
File: program.exe (15,728,640 bytes)

SHA-256 Hash:
a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789

Change ONE byte in file → Completely different hash:
x9y8z7w6v5u4321fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210
```

### Why SHA-256?

| Algorithm | Hash Size | Security | Speed | Status |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **MD5** | 128-bit | BROKEN | Very Fast | DO NOT USE |
| **SHA-1** | 160-bit | BROKEN | Fast | DEPRECATED |
| **SHA-256** | 256-bit | SECURE | Fast | **RECOMMENDED** |
| SHA-512 | 512-bit | SECURE | Medium | Overkill for files |

**CyberPatchMaker Choice**: SHA-256
- **Secure**: No known practical attacks
- **Fast**: ~500 MB/s on modern CPUs
- **Standard**: Widely supported, well-tested
- **Long-term security**: Will remain secure for many years

### Security Guarantees

**Collision Resistance**:
- Probability of finding two files with same hash: 1 in 2^128
- Practically impossible (would take trillions of years with all computers on Earth)

**Pre-image Resistance**:
- Cannot create file to match specific hash
- Cannot reverse hash to get original file
- Protects against targeted attacks

**Tamper Evidence**:
- ANY modification to file (even 1 bit) changes hash completely
- No way to modify file and keep same hash
- Perfect tamper detection

## Three Verification Points

CyberPatchMaker performs verification at three critical stages:

### 1. Pre-Patch Verification (Source Version)

**Purpose**: Ensure target directory contains EXACTLY the expected source version

**Process**:
```
1. Read patch metadata:
   - Required key file: "program.exe" with hash "abc123..."
   - Required files: 156 files with their exact hashes
   
2. Scan target directory recursively:
   - Find all files
   - Calculate SHA-256 for each file
   
3. Verify key file:
   if keyFileHash != requiredKeyFileHash {
       ABORT: "Key file mismatch - wrong version"
   }
   
4. Verify ALL required files:
   for each requiredFile {
       if fileHash != requiredHash {
           ABORT: "File mismatch - modified or corrupted installation"
       }
   }
   
5. If ALL verifications pass:
   → Proceed with patch application
```

**What Gets Verified**:
- Key file (main executable)
- ALL files that exist in source version
- Complete directory structure
- File sizes (secondary check)

**Failure Scenarios Detected**:
- Wrong version (e.g., trying to patch 1.0.1 when patch expects 1.0.0)
- Modified files (user changes, mods, cracks)
- Corrupted files (download errors, disk corruption)
- Missing files (incomplete installation)
- Extra files (OK - doesn't fail verification)

### 2. During-Patch Verification (Operations)

**Purpose**: Verify each patch operation as it's applied

**Process for MODIFY operation**:
```
1. Read operation metadata:
   - File: "program.exe"
   - Expected old hash: "abc123..."
   - Expected new hash: "xyz789..."
   - Binary diff: [compressed diff data]
   
2. Verify old file exists:
   oldHash = SHA256(oldFile)
   if oldHash != expectedOldHash {
       ABORT: "File changed since patch creation"
   }
   
3. Apply binary diff:
   newFile = applyDiff(oldFile, binaryDiff)
   
4. Verify new file:
   newHash = SHA256(newFile)
   if newHash != expectedNewHash {
       ABORT: "Patch application failed - diff corrupted"
   }
   
5. Atomically replace:
   rename(newFile, oldFile)  # Atomic operation
```

**Process for ADD operation**:
```
1. Read operation metadata:
   - File: "data/newasset.png"
   - Expected hash: "def456..."
   - Full file data: [compressed file]
   
2. Decompress and write file:
   writeFile(filePath, fileData)
   
3. Verify written file:
   actualHash = SHA256(filePath)
   if actualHash != expectedHash {
       ABORT: "File write failed - disk error or corruption"
   }
```

**Process for DELETE operation**:
```
1. Read operation metadata:
   - File: "libs/oldfile.dll"
   - Expected hash: "ghi789..."
   
2. Verify file before deletion:
   currentHash = SHA256(file)
   if currentHash != expectedHash {
       WARNING: "File modified - deleting anyway"
   }
   
3. Delete file:
   deleteFile(file)
```

**What Gets Verified**:
- Source file hash before modification
- Target file hash after modification
- Binary diff integrity (reconstructed file matches expected hash)
- File write success (disk operations succeeded)

### 3. Post-Patch Verification (Target Version)

**Purpose**: Ensure patch application resulted in EXACTLY the expected target version

**Process**:
```
1. Read patch metadata:
   - Target key file: "program.exe" with hash "xyz789..."
   - All modified/added files with their target hashes
   
2. Verify key file:
   actualKeyHash = SHA256(keyFile)
   if actualKeyHash != targetKeyHash {
       ABORT + ROLLBACK: "Key file incorrect after patch"
   }
   
3. Verify ALL modified files:
   for each modifiedFile {
       actualHash = SHA256(modifiedFile)
       if actualHash != targetHash {
           ABORT + ROLLBACK: "File verification failed after patch"
       }
   }
   
4. Verify ALL added files:
   for each addedFile {
       if !fileExists(addedFile) {
           ABORT + ROLLBACK: "Added file missing"
       }
       actualHash = SHA256(addedFile)
       if actualHash != targetHash {
           ABORT + ROLLBACK: "Added file incorrect"
       }
   }
   
5. Verify ALL deleted files:
   for each deletedFile {
       if fileExists(deletedFile) {
           ABORT + ROLLBACK: "File should be deleted but still exists"
       }
   }
   
6. If ALL verifications pass:
   → Patch application SUCCESSFUL
   → Delete backup
   → Report success to user
```

**What Gets Verified**:
- Key file matches target version exactly
- ALL modified files have correct target hashes
- ALL added files exist and have correct hashes
- ALL deleted files are gone
- Complete version integrity

**Failure Scenarios Detected**:
- Incomplete patch application (some operations failed silently)
- Disk write errors (file write succeeded but data corrupted)
- Concurrent modifications (another process changed files during patch)
- Diff application errors (binary diff produced wrong result)

## Verification Workflow Example

### Scenario: Patch 1.0.0 → 1.0.3

      "file_path": "libs/oldfile.dll",
      "old_checksum": "old999..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Hash Calculation Performance

**SHA-256 Speed** (modern CPU):
- **Algorithm speed**: ~500 MB/s per core
- **I/O bound**: Usually limited by disk speed, not CPU

**Disk Speed Impact**:
| Storage Type | Read Speed | Hash Time (1 GB file) |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| HDD (5400 RPM) | ~80 MB/s | ~13 seconds |
| HDD (7200 RPM) | ~120 MB/s | ~8 seconds |
| SATA SSD | ~500 MB/s | ~2 seconds |
| NVMe SSD | ~3000 MB/s | ~2 seconds (CPU bound) |
| Network share | ~10-100 MB/s | ~10-100 seconds |

**Key Insight**: For modern SSDs, SHA-256 is **CPU-bound** (~500 MB/s). For HDDs and network storage, it's **I/O-bound**.

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Buffered I/O

```go
func calculateSHA256(filePath string) (string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer file.Close()
    
    hasher := sha256.New()
    
    // Use 64KB buffer for optimal performance
    buffer := make([]byte, 64*1024)
    
    for {
        n, err := file.Read(buffer)
        if n > 0 {
            hasher.Write(buffer[:n])
        }
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }
    }
    
    return hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil)), nil
}
```

**Benefit**: Reduces memory usage and system call overhead.

#### 2. Parallel Hashing

```go
// Hash multiple files concurrently
func hashFilesParallel(files []string, workers int) (map[string]string, error) {
    type result struct {
        file string
        hash string
        err  error
    }
    
    jobs := make(chan string, len(files))
    results := make(chan result, len(files))
    
    // Start worker pool
    for w := 0; w < workers; w++ {
        go func() {
            for file := range jobs {
                hash, err := calculateSHA256(file)
                results <- result{file, hash, err}
            }
        }()
    }
    
    // Send jobs
    for _, file := range files {
        jobs <- file
    }
    close(jobs)
    
    // Collect results
    hashes := make(map[string]string)
    for range files {
        r := <-results
        if r.err != nil {
            return nil, r.err
        }
        hashes[r.file] = r.hash
    }
    
    return hashes, nil
}
```

**Benefit**: Utilize multiple CPU cores for faster verification of many files.

#### 3. Memory-Mapped Files (Large Files)

```go
func calculateSHA256Large(filePath string) (string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer file.Close()
    
    stat, err := file.Stat()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    // Memory-map file for large files (>100MB)
    if stat.Size() > 100*1024*1024 {
        data, err := mmap.Map(file, mmap.RDONLY, 0)
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }
        defer data.Unmap()
        
        hash := sha256.Sum256(data)
        return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:]), nil
    }
    
    // Standard buffered I/O for smaller files
    return calculateSHA256(filePath)
}
```

**Benefit**: Faster for very large files (OS handles paging efficiently).

### Performance Targets

**For 5GB Application with 1,000 files**:

| Step | Operations | Time (HDD) | Time (SSD) |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Pre-Patch Verification | Hash 1,000 files (5GB) | ~60s | ~10s |
| During-Patch | Apply 50 operations | ~10s | ~5s |
| Post-Patch Verification | Hash 50 files (500MB) | ~6s | ~1s |
| **Total** | - | **~76s** | **~16s** |

**Optimization Impact**:
- **Parallel hashing** (8 workers): 3-5x faster
- **Skip unchanged files**: 90%+ faster (cache hashes)
- **Memory-mapped I/O**: 20-30% faster for large files

## Security Considerations

### Attack Scenarios

#### Attack 1: Hash Collision

**Attacker Goal**: Create malicious file with same SHA-256 as legitimate file

**Feasibility**:
- **Computational Cost**: 2^128 operations (~10^38 hashes)
- **Time Required**: Trillions of years with all computers on Earth
- **Status**: **IMPOSSIBLE WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY**

**Protection**: SHA-256 collision resistance makes this attack infeasible.

#### Attack 2: Pre-Image Attack

**Attacker Goal**: Given hash, create file that produces that hash

**Feasibility**:
- **Computational Cost**: 2^256 operations
- **Time Required**: Beyond lifetime of universe
- **Status**: **IMPOSSIBLE**

**Protection**: SHA-256 pre-image resistance protects against targeted attacks.

#### Attack 3: Patch File Tampering

**Attacker Goal**: Modify patch file to inject malicious code

**Scenario**:
```
Legitimate patch:
  operation: MODIFY program.exe
  old_hash: abc123...
  new_hash: xyz789...  (legitimate)
  diff: [legitimate binary diff]

Tampered patch:
  operation: MODIFY program.exe
  old_hash: abc123...
  new_hash: xyz789...  (unchanged)
  diff: [malicious binary diff]  ← Modified
```

**Protection**:
1. **Post-patch verification** detects mismatch:
   - Apply malicious diff → produces file with hash "evil666..."
   - Expected hash: xyz789...
   - Actual hash: evil666... → ✗ VERIFICATION FAILS
   - Automatic rollback restores original

**Result**: Attack detected and prevented.

#### Attack 4: Man-in-the-Middle (Download Tampering)

**Attacker Goal**: Intercept patch download and replace with malicious patch

**Protection Layers**:
1. **HTTPS**: Encrypt download (prevents interception)
2. **Patch checksum**: Verify downloaded patch hash
3. **Post-patch verification**: Verify result even if malicious patch applied

**Result**: Multiple layers of protection.

### When to Skip Verification (NEVER RECOMMENDED)

**Legitimate Scenarios**:
- **Testing/Development**: Verify patch generation without full verification
- **Corrupted Source**: Force patch despite modified source (dangerous)
- **Performance**: Skip verification for trusted environments (not recommended)

**Important**: CyberPatchMaker does not currently support skipping verification. Verification is always performed to ensure data integrity and security.

## Troubleshooting Verification Failures

### Error: "Key file hash mismatch"

**Message**:
```
Error: Key file 'program.exe' hash does not match
Expected: abc123...
Got:      xyz789...
This patch requires version 1.0.0
```

**Causes**:
1. Wrong version installed (e.g., 1.0.1 instead of 1.0.0)
2. Key file modified by user (mod, crack, etc.)
3. Key file corrupted (download error, disk corruption)
4. Anti-virus modified executable

**Solutions**:
1. Run dry-run to identify issues: `patch-apply --patch patch.patch --current-dir ./app/ --dry-run`
2. Re-download clean version from official source
3. Check anti-virus logs for quarantine/restoration
4. Use SHA-256 utility to verify key file independently

### Error: "Required file hash mismatch"

**Message**:
```
Error: File 'libs/somefile.dll' has been modified
Expected: def456...
Got:      modified99...
Patch cannot be applied to modified installations
```

**Causes**:
1. User modified file
2. Another application modified file
3. Disk corruption
4. Incomplete installation

**Solutions**:
1. Identify modification source (check file modification time)
2. Restore original file from backup or installer
3. Run disk check utility (Windows: `chkdsk`, Linux: `fsck`)
4. Reinstall application cleanly

### Error: "Post-patch verification failed"

**Message**:
```
Error: File 'program.exe' verification failed after patching
Expected: xyz789...
Got:      incorrect88...
Rolling back changes...
```

**Causes**:
1. Disk write error during patching
2. Insufficient disk space
3. Corrupted binary diff in patch file
4. Concurrent file access (another process modified file)

**Solutions**:
1. Check disk space: Ensure 2x patch size available
2. Run disk check utility
3. Download patch file again (verify checksum)
4. Close all applications before patching
5. Retry patch application

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "verification_date": "2025-01-04T10:30:00Z",
  "patch": "1.0.0-to-1.0.3",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "files_verified": 156,
  "files_passed": 156,
  "files_failed": 0,
  "duration_seconds": 12.5,
  "details": [
    {
      "file": "program.exe",
      "expected_hash": "abc123...",
      "actual_hash": "abc123...",
      "status": "PASS"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Progressive Verification

**Use Case**: Provide user feedback during lengthy verification

**Design**:
```
Verifying source version...
  [████████████████████        ] 75% (120/156 files)
  Current: libs/somefile.dll
  Elapsed: 8.5s | Remaining: ~3.2s
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always Include Hashes**: Every patch must include complete hash metadata
2. **Test Verification**: Test patch with modified files to ensure verification catches errors
3. **Hash Patch Files**: Provide SHA-256 of patch file itself for download verification
4. **Document Requirements**: Clearly specify required source version

### For Users

1. **Verify Downloads**: Check patch file hash before applying
2. **Clean Installations**: Don't modify files before patching
3. **Trust Errors**: Verification failures indicate real problems - investigate before forcing
4. **Backup Important Data**: Even with verification, keep backups

### For System Administrators

1. **Verify Integrity**: Periodically verify installations match expected manifests
2. **Monitor Failures**: Track verification failures for security monitoring
3. **Automate Verification**: Include verification in deployment scripts
4. **Audit Trail**: Keep logs of verification results

## Summary

The Hash Verification System provides **cryptographic-strength integrity protection** throughout the patch lifecycle:

- **Pre-Patch**: Ensures source version is exactly correct
- **During-Patch**: Verifies each operation succeeds correctly
- **Post-Patch**: Ensures target version is exactly correct
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification detected immediately
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed verification triggers rollback
- **Zero Tolerance**: No corrupt or wrong patches accepted

**SHA-256 provides**:
- 256-bit collision resistance (practically impossible to break)
- Secure tamper detection (any byte change detected)
- Fast performance (~500 MB/s on modern CPUs)
- Industry-standard security (widely trusted and tested)
