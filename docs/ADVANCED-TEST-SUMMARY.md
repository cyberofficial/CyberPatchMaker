- Reference files in `versions/1.0.2/`

Any difference would cause test failure, ensuring perfect patch application.

---

### Cross-Compression Verification (Test 15)

#### Test 15: Verify All Compression Methods Produce Identical Results
**Purpose:** Confirm compression choice doesn't affect patch results

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify all compression methods produce identical results
  Comparing results from different compression methods...
  All compression methods produced identical results (11 files each)
✓ PASSED: Verify all compression methods produce identical results
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Result Consistency:** All three compression methods produce identical output
- **File Count:** Same number of files (11) in each result directory
- **Content Accuracy:** program.exe content is identical across all three
- **Compression Independence:** Compression only affects patch size, not results

**Verification Checks:**
```powershell
✓ test-zstd:  11 files  (zstd compression)
✓ test-gzip:  11 files  (gzip compression)
✓ test-none:  11 files  (no compression)
✓ Content matches across all three methods
```

**Analysis:**
This proves that compression is a transport/storage optimization and doesn't affect the actual patch operations or results. Users can choose compression based on their needs (speed vs compatibility) without worrying about different outcomes.

---

### Multi-Hop Patching (Test 16)

#### Test 16: Test Multi-Hop Patching Scenario
**Purpose:** Verify sequential patching works correctly (1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2)

**Command-Line Sequence:**
```
1. Generate 1.0.0→1.0.1 patch:
   Command: patch-gen.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.1 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches

2. Apply first patch:
   Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.1.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify

3. Apply second patch:
   Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Test multi-hop patching scenario
  Testing 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2 patch chain...
  Command: patch-gen.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.1 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
  Starting from version 1.0.0...
  Applying first patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)...
  Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.1.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
  Applying second patch (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)...
  Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
  Multi-hop patching successful: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
✓ PASSED: Test multi-hop patching scenario
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Sequential Patching:** Patches can be applied in sequence
- **Version Tracking:** Key file verification works at each step
- **Cumulative Changes:** Final result matches direct 1.0.0→1.0.2 patch
- **No State Corruption:** Each patch builds on previous state correctly

**Use Cases:**
- Incremental updates when direct patch isn't available
- Controlled rollout: v1 → v2 → v3 instead of v1 → v3
- Reduced patch generation: Only need adjacent version patches
- Flexibility in deployment scenarios

**Technical Validation:**
After applying both patches sequentially, the test compares the final `program.exe` content against the reference `1.0.2/program.exe`. Perfect match confirms multi-hop patching works correctly.

---

### Error Detection Tests (Tests 17-18)

#### Test 17: Verify Patch Rejection for Wrong Source Version
**Purpose:** Confirm system detects and rejects patches applied to wrong versions

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\wrong-version --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify patch rejection for wrong source version
  Testing patch rejection (applying 1.0.1→1.0.2 to 1.0.0)...
  Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\wrong-version --verify
  Patch correctly rejected for wrong source version
✓ PASSED: Verify patch rejection for wrong source version
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Key File Verification:** System checks program.exe hash before patching
- **Version Mismatch Detection:** 1.0.0's key file doesn't match 1.0.1's expected hash
- **Safe Failure:** Patch rejected with non-zero exit code
- **Error Message:** Clear error about checksum mismatch or wrong version

**Scenario:**
1. Copy version 1.0.0 to test directory
2. Try to apply 1.0.1→1.0.2 patch (requires 1.0.1 source)
3. Applier detects hash mismatch in program.exe
4. Patch rejected, no changes made

**Error Message Examples:**
- "checksum mismatch"
- "verification failed"
- "wrong version"

**Why This Matters:**
Prevents catastrophic failures from applying wrong patches. Without this check, applying a patch to the wrong version could corrupt the installation beyond repair.

---

#### Test 18: Verify Detection of Corrupted Files in Source
**Purpose:** Confirm system detects file corruption before attempting patch

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\corrupted --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify detection of corrupted files in source
  Testing corrupted file detection...
  Corrupting libs/core.dll...
  Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\corrupted --verify
  Corrupted file correctly detected
✓ PASSED: Verify detection of corrupted files in source
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Pre-Patch Verification:** All required files are hashed before patching
- **Corruption Detection:** Modified file detected via SHA-256 mismatch
- **Safe Failure:** Patch rejected before any changes made
- **Error Message:** Clear indication of which file failed verification

**Scenario:**
1. Copy version 1.0.1 to test directory
2. Corrupt `libs/core.dll` by appending "CORRUPTED DATA"
3. Try to apply 1.0.1→1.0.2 patch
4. Pre-verification detects hash mismatch in core.dll
5. Patch rejected immediately

**Why This Matters:**
Ensures patches are only applied to pristine installations. Prevents:
- Applying patches to partially-updated versions
- Building on corrupted files
- Creating unpredictable results
- Data loss from bad patch application

**Error Message Examples:**
- "checksum mismatch"
- "verification failed"
- "core.dll hash does not match"

---

### Backup System Verification (Test 19)

#### Test 19: Verify Backup System Works Correctly
**Purpose:** Confirm automatic backup creation during patch application

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\backup-test --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify backup system works correctly
  Testing backup and rollback functionality...
  Command: patch-apply.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\backup-test --verify
  Backup was created during patch application
  Backup system verified
✓ PASSED: Verify backup system works correctly
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Automatic Backup:** System creates backup before modifying files
- **Backup Message:** User is informed about backup creation
- **Safety Net:** Rollback possible if something goes wrong
- **Successful Patch:** Despite backup, patch completes successfully

**Backup Lifecycle:**
1. Pre-verification passes
2. Backup created (files copied to safe location)
3. Patch operations applied
4. Post-verification passes
5. Backup cleaned up (or kept based on settings)

**Use Cases:**
- Automatic rollback if patch fails
- Manual rollback if user wants to revert
- Safety during critical updates
- Disaster recovery

### Performance Verification (Test 20)

#### Test 20: Verify Patch Generation Performance
**Purpose:** Measure patch generation speed and ensure reasonable performance

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: patch-gen.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.2 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify patch generation performance
  Measuring patch generation time...
  Command: patch-gen.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.2 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
  Patch generation completed in 0.03 seconds
  Performance is acceptable
✓ PASSED: Verify patch generation performance
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Generation Speed:** Patch created in reasonable time
- **Baseline Performance:** Establishes expected timing
- **Performance Regression:** Detects if future changes slow down generation

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Expected:** < 1 second for test versions (small files)
- **Typical Result:** 0.02-0.05 seconds
- **Warning Threshold:** > 30 seconds (indicates performance issue)

**Analysis:**
The 1.0.0→1.0.2 patch is more complex than 1.0.1→1.0.2:
- More files changed (starting from baseline)
- Larger version gap
- Still completes in milliseconds

**Real-World Performance:**
For production use with larger applications (GBs):
- Scanning: 1-5 seconds per GB
- Diffing: 0.1-1 seconds per MB of changes
- Compression: 0.5-2 seconds per MB
- Total: Usually under 1 minute for 5GB applications with 50MB changes

---

#### Test 22: Incremental Patching

**Objective:** Test sequential patch application (version chain patching).

**Setup:**
- Apply patches in sequence: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
- Verify each step maintains integrity

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
# Apply first patch
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.1.patch --current-dir .\test-incremental --verify

# Apply second patch  
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-incremental --verify
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ First patch applies successfully
- ✓ Version becomes 1.0.1 after first patch
- ✓ Second patch applies successfully
- ✓ Final version is 1.0.2
- ✓ Final state matches direct 1.0.0→1.0.2 patch result

**Validation:**
- Version tracking works at each step
- Cumulative changes are correct
- File integrity maintained throughout chain
- Final SHA-256 hashes match expected 1.0.2 state

---

#### Test 23: Backup Creation During Patching

**Objective:** Verify that backup is automatically created before applying patches.

**Setup:**
- Clean target directory with no existing backup
- Prepare patch for application

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-backup --verify
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ `backup.cyberpatcher/` directory is created
- ✓ Backup is created before any modifications
- ✓ User is notified about backup creation
- ✓ Patch continues after backup creation

**Validation:**
- Backup directory exists at `./test-backup/backup.cyberpatcher/`
- Backup was created before patching started
- Console output shows backup creation message
- Patch completed successfully

**Behavior:**
The applier automatically creates a backup directory before making any changes. This provides a safety net if the patch fails or if manual rollback is needed later.

---

#### Test 24: Backup Preservation After Success

**Objective:** Verify that backup is kept after successful patching for manual rollback capability.

**Setup:**
- Apply patch successfully
- Verify backup state after completion

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-backup --verify

# After successful patch, check backup
Test-Path .\test-backup\backup.cyberpatcher
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Patch applies successfully
- ✓ Backup directory still exists after success
- ✓ Backup contents remain intact
- ✓ User can manually rollback if needed

**Validation:**
- `backup.cyberpatcher/` directory still exists
- Backup files are unchanged
- User has option for manual rollback
- No automatic cleanup after success

**Design Rationale:**
Backups are preserved after successful patches because:
1. Users might discover issues later that require rollback
2. Manual inspection of changes is possible
3. No automatic cleanup reduces risk
4. Users control when to remove backups

---

#### Test 25: Selective Backup Content Verification

**Objective:** Verify that backup only contains modified and deleted files, not added files.

**Setup:**
- Apply patch that adds, modifies, and deletes files
- Inspect backup contents

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-backup --verify

# Check backup contents
Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\test-backup\backup.cyberpatcher
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Modified files ARE in backup (OpModify)
- ✓ Deleted files ARE in backup (OpDelete)
- ✓ Added files are NOT in backup (OpAdd)
- ✓ Backup is much smaller than full version

**Validation:**
- Check for modified files: `data/config.json` (if modified)
- Check for deleted files: (any deleted files should be present)
- Verify new files are NOT in backup: `plugins/sample.plugin` (new in 1.0.2)
- Backup size is minimal (only changed files)

**Patch 1.0.1→1.0.2 Operations:**
- **OpModify:** `data/config.json` (modified) → **IN BACKUP**
- **OpAdd:** `plugins/` directory + files (new) → **NOT IN BACKUP**
- **OpAdd:** `data/assets/` directory (new) → **NOT IN BACKUP**
- **OpAdd:** `data/locale/` directory (new) → **NOT IN BACKUP**
- **OpAdd:** `libs/plugins/` directory (new) → **NOT IN BACKUP**

**Result:** Backup only contains ~100 bytes (config.json), not the full ~4KB of new files.

**Why Selective Backup:**
- Added files don't need backup (they don't exist in original)
- Modified files need backup (original state preservation)
- Deleted files need backup (can be restored if needed)
- Saves disk space (only backs up what can be lost)

---

#### Test 26: Manual Rollback from Backup

**Objective:** Verify that users can manually restore files from the backup directory.

**Setup:**
- Apply patch successfully (backup exists)
- Simulate needing to rollback specific file

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
# After patching, simulate rollback need
# User discovers issue and wants to restore original config.json

# Manual rollback using mirror structure
Copy-Item .\test-backup\backup.cyberpatcher\data\config.json `
          .\test-backup\data\config.json -Force
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Backup file can be copied directly to original location
- ✓ Mirror structure makes paths intuitive
- ✓ Original file is restored successfully
- ✓ No complex path mapping needed

**Validation:**
- File restored matches pre-patch state
- Hash verification confirms original content
- Mirror structure paths work 1:1
- User can restore any backed-up file easily

**Mirror Structure Advantage:**
```
Original location:  ./test-backup/data/config.json
Backup location:    ./test-backup/backup.cyberpatcher/data/config.json
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ just add this prefix
```

The mirror structure means users can intuitively find backed-up files without complex path translation.

---

#### Test 27: Backup Directory Structure Verification

**Objective:** Verify that backup preserves exact directory hierarchy (mirror structure).

**Setup:**
- Apply patch with nested directory changes
- Inspect backup directory structure

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-backup --verify

# Check directory hierarchy
Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\test-backup\backup.cyberpatcher | Select-Object FullName
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Backup preserves exact directory paths
- ✓ Nested directories are created as needed
- ✓ Empty directories are preserved if files were deleted
- ✓ Directory structure mirrors original installation

**Validation:**
- Compare directory trees:
  - Original: `./test-backup/data/config.json`
  - Backup: `./test-backup/backup.cyberpatcher/data/config.json`
- All intermediate directories exist in backup
- No path flattening or restructuring
- Mirror structure is exact

**Example Structure:**
```
test-backup/
├── data/
│   ├── config.json (modified by patch)
│   ├── assets/ (added by patch)
│   └── locale/ (added by patch)
├── libs/
│   └── plugins/ (added by patch)
├── plugins/ (added by patch)
└── backup.cyberpatcher/
    └── data/
        └── config.json (backup of original)
```

**Note:** Only `data/config.json` is backed up because it's the only modified file. New additions like `plugins/`, `assets/`, and `locale/` are NOT in backup because they're new (OpAdd operations).

---

#### Test 28: Performance Under Realistic Conditions

**Objective:** Measure backup system performance with larger, more realistic patch scenarios.

**Setup:**
- Generate patches with various sizes and complexities
- Measure backup creation and patch application time

**Test Actions:**
```powershell
# Measure patch application with backup creation
Measure-Command {
    patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\test-performance --verify
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Backup creation adds minimal overhead (< 100ms for test data)
- ✓ Total patch time remains under performance threshold (< 30 seconds)
- ✓ Backup system doesn't significantly impact user experience
- ✓ Performance scales reasonably with patch size

**Validation:**
- Record total execution time
- Compare with non-backup patch time (should be similar)
- Verify backup overhead is acceptable
- Performance meets production requirements

**Typical Performance (Test Data):**
- Patch 1.0.1→1.0.2 (4 operations, ~4KB changes):
  - Without backup: ~0.02 seconds
  - With backup: ~0.025 seconds
  - Overhead: ~5ms (25% increase, but still instantaneous)

**Real-World Expectations (5GB Application):**
- Full scan: 1-5 seconds
- Backup creation: 0.1-0.5 seconds (only modified files)
- Patching: 5-30 seconds (depends on changes)
- Total: Usually under 1 minute

**Performance Targets:**
- ✓ Backup creation < 10% of total patch time
- ✓ Total time < 30 seconds for typical updates
- ✓ User experience remains smooth
- ✓ No noticeable lag for small patches

## Command-Line Pattern Reference

### Generator Command Pattern
```powershell
patch-gen.exe --versions-dir <path> --from <version> --to <version> --output <path> [--compression <type>]
```

**Options:**
- `--versions-dir`: Root directory containing all version folders
- `--from`: Source version number (e.g., "1.0.1")
- `--to`: Target version number (e.g., "1.0.2")
- `--output`: Directory where patch file will be created
- `--compression`: Optional compression type (zstd, gzip, none)

**Example:**
```powershell
patch-gen.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.1 --to 1.0.2 --output .\patches --compression zstd
```

---

### Applier Command Pattern
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch <patch-file> --current-dir <directory> [--verify] [--dry-run]
```

**Options:**
- `--patch`: Path to the .patch file to apply
- `--current-dir`: Directory containing the current version to update
- `--verify`: Enable SHA-256 verification (recommended)
- `--dry-run`: Simulate patch without making changes

**Example:**
```powershell
patch-apply.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\app --verify
```

---

## Test Data Cleanup

After all tests complete, the suite prompts for cleanup:

```
========================================
Test Data Cleanup
========================================

Test data is located in: .\testdata\

Would you like to clean up test data now? (Y/N):
```

**Options:**
- **Y (Yes):** Immediately deletes all test data
- **N (No):** Keeps test data for inspection, creates `.cleanup-deferred` marker

**Auto-Cleanup Behavior:**
If you choose "N", the next test run will automatically:
1. Detect the `.cleanup-deferred` marker
2. Remove old test data
3. Generate fresh test data
4. Run all tests

This allows you to inspect test results without permanently accumulating test data.
