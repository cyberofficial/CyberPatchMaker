  All compression methods produced identical results (11 files each)
✓ PASSED: Verify all compression methods produce identical results
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Result Consistency:** All three compression methods produce identical output
- **File Count:** Same number of files (11) in each result directory
- **Content Accuracy:** program.exe content is identical across all three
- **Compression Independence:** Compression only affects patch size, not results

**Verification Checks:**
```powershell
✓ test-zstd:  11 files  (zstd compression)
✓ test-gzip:  11 files  (gzip compression)
✓ test-none:  11 files  (no compression)
✓ Content matches across all three methods
```

**Analysis:**
This proves that compression is a transport/storage optimization and doesn't affect the actual patch operations or results. Users can choose compression based on their needs (speed vs compatibility) without worrying about different outcomes.

---

### Multi-Hop Patching Phase (Test 16)

#### Test 16: Test Multi-Hop Patching Scenario
**Purpose:** Verify sequential patching works correctly (1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2)

**Command-Line Sequence:**
```
1. Generate 1.0.0→1.0.1 patch:
   Command: generator.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.1 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches

2. Apply first patch:
   Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.1.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify

3. Apply second patch:
   Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Test multi-hop patching scenario
  Testing 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2 patch chain...
  Command: generator.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.1 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
  Starting from version 1.0.0...
  Applying first patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)...
  Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.0-to-1.0.1.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
  Applying second patch (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)...
  Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\multi-hop --verify
  Multi-hop patching successful: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
✓ PASSED: Test multi-hop patching scenario
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Sequential Patching:** Patches can be applied in sequence
- **Version Tracking:** Key file verification works at each step
- **Cumulative Changes:** Final result matches direct 1.0.0→1.0.2 patch
- **No State Corruption:** Each patch builds on previous state correctly

**Use Cases:**
- Incremental updates when direct patch isn't available
- Controlled rollout: v1 → v2 → v3 instead of v1 → v3
- Reduced patch generation: Only need adjacent version patches
- Flexibility in deployment scenarios

**Technical Validation:**
After applying both patches sequentially, the test compares the final `program.exe` content against the reference `1.0.2/program.exe`. Perfect match confirms multi-hop patching works correctly.

---

### Error Detection Phase (Tests 17-18)

#### Test 17: Verify Patch Rejection for Wrong Source Version
**Purpose:** Confirm system detects and rejects patches applied to wrong versions

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\wrong-version --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify patch rejection for wrong source version
  Testing patch rejection (applying 1.0.1→1.0.2 to 1.0.0)...
  Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\wrong-version --verify
  Patch correctly rejected for wrong source version
✓ PASSED: Verify patch rejection for wrong source version
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Key File Verification:** System checks program.exe hash before patching
- **Version Mismatch Detection:** 1.0.0's key file doesn't match 1.0.1's expected hash
- **Safe Failure:** Patch rejected with non-zero exit code
- **Error Message:** Clear error about checksum mismatch or wrong version

**Scenario:**
1. Copy version 1.0.0 to test directory
2. Try to apply 1.0.1→1.0.2 patch (requires 1.0.1 source)
3. Applier detects hash mismatch in program.exe
4. Patch rejected, no changes made

**Error Message Examples:**
- "checksum mismatch"
- "verification failed"
- "wrong version"

**Why This Matters:**
Prevents catastrophic failures from applying wrong patches. Without this check, applying a patch to the wrong version could corrupt the installation beyond repair.

---

#### Test 18: Verify Detection of Corrupted Files in Source
**Purpose:** Confirm system detects file corruption before attempting patch

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\corrupted --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify detection of corrupted files in source
  Testing corrupted file detection...
  Corrupting libs/core.dll...
  Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\corrupted --verify
  Corrupted file correctly detected
✓ PASSED: Verify detection of corrupted files in source
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Pre-Patch Verification:** All required files are hashed before patching
- **Corruption Detection:** Modified file detected via SHA-256 mismatch
- **Safe Failure:** Patch rejected before any changes made
- **Error Message:** Clear indication of which file failed verification

**Scenario:**
1. Copy version 1.0.1 to test directory
2. Corrupt `libs/core.dll` by appending "CORRUPTED DATA"
3. Try to apply 1.0.1→1.0.2 patch
4. Pre-verification detects hash mismatch in core.dll
5. Patch rejected immediately

**Why This Matters:**
Ensures patches are only applied to pristine installations. Prevents:
- Applying patches to partially-updated versions
- Building on corrupted files
- Creating unpredictable results
- Data loss from bad patch application

**Error Message Examples:**
- "checksum mismatch"
- "verification failed"
- "core.dll hash does not match"

---

### Backup System Verification Phase (Test 19)

#### Test 19: Verify Backup System Works Correctly
**Purpose:** Confirm automatic backup creation during patch application

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\backup-test --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify backup system works correctly
  Testing backup and rollback functionality...
  Command: applier.exe --patch .\testdata\advanced-output\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\testdata\advanced-output\backup-test --verify
  Backup was created during patch application
  Backup system verified
✓ PASSED: Verify backup system works correctly
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Automatic Backup:** System creates backup before modifying files
- **Backup Message:** User is informed about backup creation
- **Safety Net:** Rollback possible if something goes wrong
- **Successful Patch:** Despite backup, patch completes successfully

**Backup Lifecycle:**
1. Pre-verification passes
2. Backup created (files copied to safe location)
3. Patch operations applied
4. Post-verification passes
5. Backup cleaned up (or kept based on settings)

**Use Cases:**
- Automatic rollback if patch fails
- Manual rollback if user wants to revert
- Safety during critical updates
- Disaster recovery

---

### Performance Verification Phase (Test 20)

#### Test 20: Verify Patch Generation Performance
**Purpose:** Measure patch generation speed and ensure reasonable performance

**Command-Line:**
```
Command: generator.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.2 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Testing: Verify patch generation performance
  Measuring patch generation time...
  Command: generator.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.2 --output .\testdata\advanced-output\patches
  Patch generation completed in 0.03 seconds
  Performance is acceptable
✓ PASSED: Verify patch generation performance
```

**What This Tests:**
- **Generation Speed:** Patch created in reasonable time
- **Baseline Performance:** Establishes expected timing
- **Performance Regression:** Detects if future changes slow down generation

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Expected:** < 1 second for test versions (small files)
- **Typical Result:** 0.02-0.05 seconds
- **Warning Threshold:** > 30 seconds (indicates performance issue)

**Analysis:**
The 1.0.0→1.0.2 patch is more complex than 1.0.1→1.0.2:
- More files changed (starting from baseline)
- Larger version gap
- Still completes in milliseconds

**Real-World Performance:**
For production use with larger applications (GBs):
- Scanning: 1-5 seconds per GB
- Diffing: 0.1-1 seconds per MB of changes
- Compression: 0.5-2 seconds per MB
- Total: Usually under 1 minute for 5GB applications with 50MB changes

- `--to`: Target version number (e.g., "1.0.2")
- `--output`: Directory where patch file will be created
- `--compression`: Optional compression type (zstd, gzip, none)

**Example:**
```powershell
generator.exe --versions-dir .\testdata\versions --from 1.0.1 --to 1.0.2 --output .\patches --compression zstd
```

---

### Applier Command Pattern
```powershell
applier.exe --patch <patch-file> --current-dir <directory> [--verify] [--dry-run]
```

**Options:**
- `--patch`: Path to the .patch file to apply
- `--current-dir`: Directory containing the current version to update
- `--verify`: Enable SHA-256 verification (recommended)
- `--dry-run`: Simulate patch without making changes

**Example:**
```powershell
applier.exe --patch .\patches\1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir .\app --verify
```

## Test Data Cleanup

After all tests complete, the suite prompts for cleanup:

```
========================================
Test Data Cleanup
========================================

Test data is located in: .\testdata\

Would you like to clean up test data now? (Y/N):
```

**Options:**
- **Y (Yes):** Immediately deletes all test data
- **N (No):** Keeps test data for inspection, creates `.cleanup-deferred` marker

**Auto-Cleanup Behavior:**
If you choose "N", the next test run will automatically:
1. Detect the `.cleanup-deferred` marker
2. Remove old test data
3. Generate fresh test data
4. Run all tests

This allows you to inspect test results without permanently accumulating test data.

## Interpreting Test Failures

### Build Failures (Tests 1-2)
**Symptoms:**
```
Testing: Build generator tool... ✗ FAILED
  Generator compilation failed
```

**Common Causes:**
- Go version too old (need 1.21+)
- Missing dependencies
- Syntax errors in code
- Build environment issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check Go version: `go version`
2. Update dependencies: `go mod tidy`
3. Verify source code compiles: `go build ./...`
4. Check error messages in build output

---

### Generation Failures (Tests 4-6)
**Symptoms:**
```
Testing: Generate complex patch... ✗ FAILED
  Generator failed with exit code 1
```

**Common Causes:**
- Version directories missing or corrupted
- Insufficient disk space
- Permission issues
- Corrupted test data

**Solutions:**
1. Verify version directories exist
2. Check disk space
3. Run with administrator privileges
4. Delete and regenerate test data

---

### Application Failures (Tests 9-11)
**Symptoms:**
```
Testing: Apply zstd patch... ✗ FAILED
  Patch application failed: verification error
```

**Common Causes:**
- Patch file corrupted
- Source version doesn't match patch requirements
- Insufficient disk space
- Permission issues on target directory

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate patch files
2. Verify source version is correct
3. Check disk space
4. Verify write permissions on target directory

---

### Verification Failures (Tests 12-15)
**Symptoms:**
```
Testing: Verify complex directory structure... ✗ FAILED
  Nested directory data/assets/images not created
```

**Common Causes:**
- Patch application incomplete
- Directory creation failed
- Path too long (Windows MAX_PATH issue)

**Solutions:**
1. Check patch application completed successfully
2. Verify no errors during patch application
3. On Windows, enable long path support
