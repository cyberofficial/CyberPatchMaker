# CyberPatchMaker

**Update your software smarter, not harder.**

CyberPatchMaker creates tiny update files for large applications. Instead of downloading a whole 5GB app again, download just a few megabytes of changes.

## Why Use CyberPatchMaker?

Imagine you have a 5GB application. You make some small changes and release version 1.0.1. Without CyberPatchMaker, users download the entire 5GB again. With CyberPatchMaker, they download only a few MB patch file that contains just the changes.

**Real-world example:**
- Version 1.0.0: 5GB application
- Version 1.0.1: 5GB application (only a few files changed)
- **Traditional update:** Download 5GB again 😞
- **With CyberPatchMaker:** Download 5MB patch file 🎉

Perfect for:
- Game developers releasing updates
- Software companies with large applications
- Anyone who wants to save bandwidth and user time

## Key Features

✅ **Safe & Reliable** - Automatic verification and rollback if anything goes wrong  
✅ **Efficient** - Smart compression reduces patch sizes by ~60%  
✅ **Bidirectional** - Generate both upgrade and downgrade patches for version flexibility  
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
✅ **Developer-Friendly** - Simple command-line tools  
✅ **Production-Ready** - Built-in backup and recovery systems  
✨ **Self-Contained Executables** - Create standalone `.exe` files for easy end-user distribution **(New!)**

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Requirements:** Go 1.21 or later

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/cyberofficial/CyberPatchMaker.git
cd CyberPatchMaker
go build ./cmd/generator
go build ./cmd/applier
```

📖 **Detailed setup:** See [Development Setup Guide](docs/development-setup.md)

## Basic Usage

### Creating a Patch

Generate patches for a new version of your software:

```bash
generator --versions-dir ./versions --new-version 1.0.3 --output ./patches
```

This automatically creates patch files from all previous versions to version 1.0.3.

### Applying a Patch

Update your application with a patch file:

```bash
# Test first (dry-run)
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./app --dry-run

# Apply the update
applier --patch ./patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.3.patch --current-dir ./app --verify
```

The `--verify` flag ensures everything is checked before and after patching, with automatic rollback if anything goes wrong.

- [Downgrade Guide](docs/downgrade-guide.md) - Rollback to previous versions

### Downgrade Patches (Rolling Back)

Need to rollback to a previous version? CyberPatchMaker supports bidirectional patches:

```bash
# Generate downgrade patch
generator --from 1.0.3 --to 1.0.2 --versions-dir ./versions --output ./patches/downgrade

# Apply downgrade to rollback
applier --patch ./patches/downgrade/1.0.3-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir ./app --verify
```

This allows users to safely revert to an earlier version if needed.

## How It Works (Simple Version)

CyberPatchMaker compares two versions of your software and creates a small patch file containing only the differences. When users apply the patch, it safely updates their installation with built-in verification and rollback protection.

**The process:**
1. **Generate:** Compare old version with new version → Create small patch file
2. **Distribute:** Share the tiny patch file instead of the full application
3. **Apply:** Users run the patch → Their software updates safely

**Safety features:**
- ✅ Verifies files before patching (catches corruption early)
- ✅ Creates automatic backup
- ✅ Verifies files after patching
- ✅ Automatic rollback if anything fails

## Complete Example

Here's a typical workflow from start to finish:

```bash
# 1. You have a new version ready
mkdir versions/1.0.2
# (copy your new version files into versions/1.0.2/)

# 2. Generate patch files
generator --versions-dir ./versions --new-version 1.0.2 --output ./patches
# Creates: patches/1.0.0-to-1.0.2.patch
#          patches/1.0.1-to-1.0.2.patch

# 3. Distribute patch files to users
# (upload to your website, CDN, etc.)

# 4. Users test the patch first (optional but recommended)
applier --patch 1.0.0-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir ./myapp --dry-run

# 5. Users apply the patch
applier --patch 1.0.0-to-1.0.2.patch --current-dir ./myapp --verify
# Done! Their version 1.0.0 is now version 1.0.2
```
